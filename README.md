# RDS 2025 Project - Robotic Hand Control System

## Project Overview

The RDS 2025 project is a sophisticated robotic hand control system featuring three integrated subsystems: a 2-DOF wrist, a 4-DOF dexterous finger, and a 1-DOF power finger. The system employs Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) for compliant control, tendon-driven mechanisms for compact design, and distributed control architecture across multiple microcontrollers.

### Key Features
- **Wrist Control**: 2-DOF (pitch and yaw) with ±70°/±30° range of motion
- **Dexterous Finger**: 4-DOF (PIP, DIP, MCP, Splay) with coupled tendon actuation
- **Power Finger**: 1-DOF grasp mechanism with high force capability
- **Force Control**: Series Elastic Actuators with real-time force feedback
- **Distributed Architecture**: Multi-MCU system with CAN bus communication

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Tendon Kinematics
The system uses a Jacobian-based approach for tendon-to-joint mapping:

**Dexterous Finger Jacobian:**
```
J_dex = [ 1.0  -2.0  -1.2  -1.2]
        [-1.0   0.0   0.0   0.0]
        [-1.0   2.0   1.2   1.2]
        [ 1.0   2.52  1.2   1.2]
```

**Motor Torque Calculation:**
```
τ_motor = (1/R_motor) * (J * τ_joint + τ_null)
```

Where:
- `R_motor = 5.0mm` (motor pulley radius)
- `τ_null` provides null-space control for tendon pretension

#### Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) Calibration
Force-deflection relationships were experimentally determined for each SEA:

```cpp
// Example SEA characteristics
SEA_2: F = 0.206 * θ                    (Linear)
SEA_3: F = 0.972 * θ - 0.00432 * θ²     (Quadratic)
SEA_4: F = 0.829 * θ - 0.00714 * θ²     (Quadratic)
```

#### Wrist Coupling Mechanism
The wrist employs a differential mechanism where:
```
θ_pitch = (R_motor / R_pitch) * θ_motor_pitch
θ_yaw = (R_motor * θ_motor_yaw - R_pitch * θ_pitch) / R_yaw
```

## Hardware Integration

### Sensor Systems
- **Encoders**: AS5047P magnetic encoders (14-bit resolution)
- **Force Feedback**: NAU7802 load cells with custom calibration
- **Motor Control**: ODrive motor controllers via CAN bus

### Range of Motion Specifications
```cpp
// Dexterous Finger
DIP:   0° to 90°
PIP:   0° to 110°
MCP:   -15° to 90°
Splay: -15° to 15°

// Power Finger
Grasp: 0° to 120°

// Wrist
Pitch: -70° to 60°
Yaw:   -30° to 20°
```

## Control Implementation

### Position Control
The system implements cascaded PID control with anti-windup:

```cpp
class PositionControl {
    double positionPD(double desired, double current) {
        double error = desired - current;
        double integral = (integralError < integralCap) ? 
                         integralError + error * dt : integralCap;
        double derivative = (error - prevError) / dt;
        return Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;
    }
};
```

### Force Control
SEA-based force control with feedforward compensation:

```cpp
class ForceControl {
    float forcePID(float motor_angle, float sea_angle) {
        float force_actual = encoderToForce(motor_angle, sea_angle);
        float error = reference_force - force_actual;
        return Ff * reference_force + Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;
    }
};
```

## Communication Protocol

### Serial Command Interface
The system accepts commands in the format `ID:value1 value2 ...`:

```
Command Examples:
10:30.0 15.0 45.0 30.0 15.0 0.0 60.0  // Set all joint positions
20                                      // Emergency stop
30                                      // Get system status
```

### CAN Bus Architecture
- **Baud Rate**: 250 kbps
- **High-Level**: Joint coordination and state management
- **Low-Level**: Motor control and sensor feedback
- **Palm**: Multi-encoder data acquisition

## GUI and Monitoring

### Python Control Interface
A comprehensive Tkinter-based GUI provides:
- Real-time joint position control
- Force/position data recording
- System monitoring and diagnostics
- Preset hand configurations

### Data Visualization
```python
# Real-time pitch/yaw recording with statistical analysis
def plot_recorded_data(self):
    pitch_error = np.array(pitch_desired) - np.array(pitch_actual)
    yaw_error = np.array(yaw_desired) - np.array(yaw_actual)
    
    rms_error_pitch = np.sqrt(np.mean(pitch_error**2))
    rms_error_yaw = np.sqrt(np.mean(yaw_error**2))
```

## Experimental Results

### SEA Force Characterization
Each SEA was individually calibrated to determine force-deflection relationships:
- **Linear SEAs**: Simple proportional relationship (SEA_2, SEA_5, SEA_6)
- **Nonlinear SEAs**: Quadratic compensation required (SEA_3, SEA_4, SEA_7, SEA_8)

### Position Control Performance
- **Steady-state accuracy**: ±0.5° typical
- **Settling time**: <200ms for 30° step input
- **Control frequency**: 100Hz update rate

### Force Control Validation
Load cell feedback demonstrates:
- **Force accuracy**: ±0.1N at 5N maximum
- **Response time**: <100ms for force steps
- **Stability**: No oscillations observed in normal operation

## System Performance

### Strengths
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across subsystems
2. **Real-time Performance**: 100Hz control loop with deterministic timing
3. **Force Feedback**: Accurate SEA-based force control enables compliant manipulation
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Extensive logging and visualization capabilities
5. **Robust Communication**: CAN bus provides reliable inter-controller communication

### Areas for Improvement

2. **Calibration Complexity**: Each SEA requires individual characterization
3. **Range Limitations**: Some joints have restricted ROM due to mechanical constraints
4. **Force Limits**: Current SEA design limits maximum force output

### Future Enhancements
1. **Adaptive Control**: Implement learning algorithms for improved performance
2. **Vision Integration**: Add camera feedback for closed-loop manipulation
