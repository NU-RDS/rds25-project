## 3. ðŸš€ Project Goals

Our primary objective for Spring 2025 was to **consolidate disparate electrical subsystems** into a **modular, unified PCB stack** that handled:

| Domain                    | Responsibilities                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸŸ§ **Power Domain**        | 24V input â†’ 5V regulation and stable power delivery    |
| ðŸŸ¦ **Switching Domain**    | 40kHz gate driving and isolation switching logic       |
| ðŸŸ© **Logic & Communication** | SPI, CAN, and MCU interfacing for control & telemetry |

The design is structured for **stackable, role-specific PCBs**, easing debugging, replacement, and scalability. The final layout aggregates all functional blocks into a clear topological arrangement, as shown below.

We defined success as:
- A **working modular board system** with power, logic, and switching blocks  
- Compatibility with **existing Teensy-based controllers**  
- Future-ready for **multi-channel motor drivers**

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Start with power-first design            | Energy availability drives all decisions      |
| Use precise current measurement early    | Debugging low-power bugs is easier upfront    |
| Version-control firmware + hardware docs | Prevent loss of institutional knowledge       |
| Modularize and test incrementally        | Complex systems fail at integration           |
