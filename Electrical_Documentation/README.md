## 3. Project Goals

Our primary objective for Spring 2025 was to **consolidate disparate electrical subsystems** into a **modular, unified PCB stack** 

The existing tooling had several known drawbacks.

| Existing tool | Drawback |
|----------------|----------------------------|
|ODrive |Finicky SPI connectors, Exclusive support list for peripherals, Wasted Z space, Limited power output, Only drives one motor |
|Ivor's Boards | No Logic domain |
|Teensy 4.1 |Large Footprint, finnicky connectora for wire harnesses |
|RDS '24 PDU |Separate from other boards, does not readily accept wire harnesses |
|Prefabbed encoders|Large footprint, does not readily accept wire harnesses |


Our design goal was structured for **stackable, role-specific PCBs**, easing debugging, replacement, and scalability. The final layout aggregates all functional blocks into a clear topological arrangement, as shown below. Specifically, we wanted to handle:

| Domain                    | Responsibilities                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸŸ§ **Power Domain**        | 24V input â†’ 5V regulation and stable power delivery    |
| ðŸŸ¦ **Switching Domain**    | 40kHz gate driving and isolation switching logic       |
| ðŸŸ© **Logic & Communication** | SPI, CAN, and MCU interfacing for control & telemetry |

We defined success as:
- A **working modular board system** with power, logic, and switching blocks  
- Compatibility with **existing Teensy-based controllers**  
- Future-ready for **multi-channel motor drivers**

## 6. Issues and Painpoints

| Category          | Problem                              | Resolution / Notes                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Encoder sizing and wiring   | 10mm form factor requested by the mechanical team was exceedingly difficult. The encoder is 7mm wide, and locking molex connectors are larger than 10mm      |   12mm Circular encoders were soldered directly to vias. 10mm rectangular boards required the 5-pin SPI alternative approach               |
| Encoder wiring| 5-pin SPI was done incorrectly, with MOSI bridged to GND instead of 5V| 5 pin SPI being a risky hardware decision, double the 12mm circular encoders were ordered. Bridging pins on the rctangular form factors did work, but they were so fragile we abandoned it. Hot glue could have been explored, but enougn 12mm encoders existed to bypass the issue |
| SPI Communication           | After 4 encoders were connected to a single teensy, SPI would become unresponsive. While MUXing the SPI lines with separate CS pins, we added additional capacitance to the MISO line with each additional encoder.        |  4 Teensy boards were required to achieve 16 joint and SEA encoders. In future iterations, it is recommended to use a MUX IC which physically disconnects MISO lines, bypassing the issue of additional parasitic capacitance.                |
| CAN power                   | Our daughter board was designed to use 5V for CAN, while the ODrive uses 12V.        |  We pivoted to Han's boad and disconnected the power domain and reconnected a 12V domain.                |
| Custom Motor Driver         | There was an issue in which the CS pin was preventing normal control of the motors        | Fixed the CS pin                 |
| Custom Motor Driver         |After fixing the CS pin, the board caught fire due to overheating or a short      | Ongoing, we are next looking at scheduling a customer service call with TI             |
| Teensy 4.0 Daughter Board   | Incorrect CS pins and CAN power wiring        |   Cut traces and jumper wire               |
| PDU board  | Flipped CAN connector    |   Flip wires around             |

## 8. Recommendations for Future Teams

| Tip                                      | Why It Matters                               |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Order extremely early          | Hardware never works 100% the first time. Plan to order twice     |
| Do not plan to make your own wire harnesses. Try and make QWIIC or something COTS work     | Not a good time. Eats up many many hours you did not account for    |
| Add test points and jumpers for current readings          | Hardware never works 100% the first time. Plan to  debug    |
| Order 2x what you think you may need         |You will have to pivot and you will also break things. Have room to bend not break  |
| Pursue 2 options at once       | Our team was big enough for someone to freelance and build their own version. This saved us because it was compatible with ODrive.  |
|Be backward compatible | Plan to resort to the previous generation. Whether that is ODRive or something else, make sure what already works will continue to work before getting fancy and adding stuff |
|Materials you didnt think about | Wiring harnesses, shrink wrap, braided wire, crimping tools|
|Equipment you didnt think about | The 3 separate benchtop power supplies is gross. Getting an all-in-one with current limits would be nice. Think about power distribution too. Look at how many wires are on our device- it gets out of control fast and can be minimized. Even with our original plan, wire routing would have been somewhat messy. I recommend making the power domain much prettier and more professional|
