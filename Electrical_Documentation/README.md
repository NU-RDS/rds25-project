## 3. Project Goals

Our primary objective for Spring 2025 was to **consolidate disparate electrical subsystems** into a **modular, unified PCB stack** 

The existing tooling had several known drawbacks.

| Existing tool | Drawback |
|----------------|----------------------------|
|ODrive |Finicky SPI connectors, Exclusive support list for peripherals, Wasted Z space, Limited power output, Only drives one motor |
|Ivor's Boards | No Logic domain |
|Teensy 4.1 |Large Footprint, finnicky readily accept wire harnesses |
|RDS '24 PDU |Separate from other boards, does not readily accept wire harnesses |
|Prefabbed encoders|Large footprint, does not readily accept wire harnesses |


Our design goal was structured for **stackable, role-specific PCBs**, easing debugging, replacement, and scalability. The final layout aggregates all functional blocks into a clear topological arrangement, as shown below. Specifically, we wanted to handle:

| Domain                    | Responsibilities                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸŸ§ **Power Domain**        | 24V input â†’ 5V regulation and stable power delivery    |
| ðŸŸ¦ **Switching Domain**    | 40kHz gate driving and isolation switching logic       |
| ðŸŸ© **Logic & Communication** | SPI, CAN, and MCU interfacing for control & telemetry |

We defined success as:
- A **working modular board system** with power, logic, and switching blocks  
- Compatibility with **existing Teensy-based controllers**  
- Future-ready for **multi-channel motor drivers**

## 4. Project Plans and Backup Plans

| Plan Order       | Status / Result                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A                |  Our custom board interfaces with a controlling teensy, and talks over CAN to a palm sensor board which aggregates data over SPI from encoders|
| B                |  Use our daughter board with Ivor's V2 motor driver |
| C                |  Use our daughter board with Ivor's V1 motor driver |
| D                |  Resort back to Odrive and any combination of logic which is compatible with that architecture|
